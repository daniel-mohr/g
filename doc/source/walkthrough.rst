walkthrough pydabu
==================

your data
---------

Your data is nothing more than a data bubble, until it is:

  * described
  * shared
  * published

pydabu can help you to describe your data. Think of a simple kind of a
basic data management plan (cf. [wikipedia:DMP]_; [RDA_DMP]_),
which is good research practice (cf. [DFG]_; [Helmholtz]_).

Like your data itself, a description of your data can be shared.
For example if in-house a search platform (e. g. [Solr]_) is running, you
could share your description of your data and enable your colleagues to find
your data.

During publication you will most probably need a description of your data.
